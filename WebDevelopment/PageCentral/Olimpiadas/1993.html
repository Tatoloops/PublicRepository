			<h2>Spanish Math Olympiads</h2>
			<h3>National Phase 1993 (Madrid)</h3>
			<h4>First Sesion</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>1</big>.- In a meeting, there are 201 people, from 5 different nationalities. It is known that, in every group of 6, there are at least two from the same age. Demonstrate that there are at least 5 people from the same country, same age and same gender.	
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>2</big>.- Giving the following arithmetic triangle:

			</p>
			<pre>
			0		1		2		3		4		...		1991		1992		1993


				1		3		5		7		...		...		3983		3985


					4		8		12		...		...		...		7968


						...		...		...		...		...		...
			</pre>
			<p>
				every number is the sum of the two numbers above it (every row has one less number, and there is only one number in the last row). Demonstrate that the last number is multiple of 1993.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>3</big>.- Justify with reason that, in any triangle, the diameter of the inscribed circumference is not greater than the radius of the circumscribed circunference.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h4>
				Second Sesion
			</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>4</big>.- Demonstate that for any prime number <big>p</big> different thank 2 and 5, there are infinite multiples of p in the form 1111...1 (written with only ones).
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>5</big>.- There are 16 points forming a grid like in the following figure:
			
			<pre><big>
							o	o	o	X	D

							o	o	o	o

							o	o	o	o

						A	X	o	o	o
			</big></pre>
			
			</p>
			<p>
				From these points we have A and D. It is requested to use other two points (besides A and D) B and C with the condition that the six distances determined by the four points are different. Study the following:
			</p>
			<p>
				a)	The amount of 4 point figures that exist with the given conditions
			</p>
			<p>
				b)	How many of these figures are geometrically different, meaning, they are not transformations of each other
			<p>
				c)	If every point is designed for a pair <big>(X<sub><small>i</small></sub>, Y<sub><small>j</small></sub>),</big> reason that the sum:
			</p>
			<pre>
					<big>|X<sub><small>i</small></sub> - X<sub><small>j</small></sub>| + |Y<sub><small>i</small></sub> - Y<sub><small>j</small></sub>|</big>
			</pre>
			<p>
				extended to the six pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is constant.
				
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				<big>6</big>.- A game machine from a casino has a screen in which there is shown a diagram like the one in the figure. To begin the game, a ball appears in the point S. The ball moves every turn towards one of the inmediate letters with the same amount of chances towards each one of them. the match ends with any of the following outcomes:
			</p>
			<p>
				a)	The ball goes back to S, then the player loses.	
			</p>
			<p>
				b)	The ball reaches G, then the player wins.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is requested to find the probabilities of the player to win, and the average length of the game.
